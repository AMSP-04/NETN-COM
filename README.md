# NETN-COM
NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Communication (COM) Module. 
        
This module is a specification of how to represent Communication Networks and related data to be shared among participants in a federated distributed simulation. The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and primarily intended to support interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. An HLA OMT based Federation Object Model (FOM) is used to specify types of data and how it is encoded on the network. The NETN COM FOM module is available as a XML file for use in HLA based federations.
        

## Purpose
The purpose of the NETN COM module is to provide a standard way to exchange data related to Communication Networks and the status och communication links. The main objective is to provide a generic model that represents the status of communication links.        

## Status

The NETN-COM FOM Module is currently being drafted and there is no release yet. See develp branch.
